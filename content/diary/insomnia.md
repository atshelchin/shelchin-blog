Recently, I've been waking up in the middle of the night often, which is causing headaches during the day at work.

GPT4 has provided me with some suggestions to help improve sleep quality and alleviate headaches.

1. Establish a fixed time for going to bed and waking up, such as sleeping at 10:00 PM and waking up at 6:00 AM.
2. Avoid having dinner too late or eating too much, especially steer clear of spicy and greasy foods.
3.  Maintain a balanced diet, ensure an adequate intake of water, and make sure to consume essential vitamins and minerals.
4. Do not play with your phone in bed.
5. Establish a consistent bedtime routine, such as reading or listening to soft music, to help your body and mind prepare for sleep.
6. Relax by taking deep breaths.

I plan to follow these suggestions and try self-adjustment for three months. During this period, I will record the state before going to bed and upon waking up in this journal every day to observe the results.
